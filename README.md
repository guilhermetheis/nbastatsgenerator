# NBA Stats Generator

## Introduction

This project intends to generate daily data for each team and each player of the NBA. 

## References

[This repo seems to do exactly what intended with this code](https://github.com/erilu/web-scraping-NBA-statistics). The repository itself is extremely useful, but it seems somewhat rigid. I'll be doing it mostly my way. It seems that, as of right now, the baseline project works with careers. Meanwhile I'd like to be able to plot daily sort-of-speaking. This is to generate the data daily and present it. Little post-processing is intended. It is to show ppg evolution, 3PT% evolution, standings, etc. 

## Roadmap

- [X] Extract all teams
- [X] Extract all player infos
- [ ] Create a table out of it
